I've been thinking a lot of politics. I voted today, and have been thinking of my civic duty. On one hand, we all have a civic duty to speak our minds and help choose politicians. On the other hand, is everyone really qualified to do that? Is the majority always right? History shows countless examples where the majority has been horribly, horribly wrong.
